Artices by Brian Rosner
=======================

I've been trying to find a decent solution to publishing longer pieces which
would be mostly how-tos. I had a blog at oebfare.com which I never really
liked. It never felt right to me to write tutorials there since I really
wanted them versioned (unfortunately I can't write perfect articles).

I once published an article as a gist which seemed to work well. However,
GitHub's gist feature has some lacking features. Today it hit me. Why not just
make a repo since git solves the content publish/editing piece and GitHub
repos are perfect for the watching/diff'ing aspects.

The best way forward is that a single commit will act as the initial version
which can be commented on (even inline comments). Then I can make commits on
an article which will act as the revisions. Of course people can fork, but
that might not be much benefit (or perhaps I can will be proven wrong). Pull
requests is an interesting idea though.

Let's give this a shot...
